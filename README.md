# Business context
The Nielsen BookScan service is the world’s largest continuous book sales tracking service in the world, operating in the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa, Italy, Spain, Mexico, Brazil, Poland, and Colombia. Nielsen BookScan collects transactional data at the point of sale, directly from tills and dispatch systems of all major book retailers. This ensures detailed and highly accurate sales information on which books are selling and at what price, giving clients the most up-to-date and relevant data. The Nielsen BookScan Total Consumer Market (TCM) data covers approximately 90% of all retail print book purchases in the UK. The remaining sites are specialised, such as gift shops, specialist booksellers, and tourist information centres.

Nielsen BookScan can be used to:

Monitor titles and authors against the competition and overall market.
Analyse pricing and discounting by format or category.
Gauge the success of marketing campaigns and promotions.
See which categories are growing and declining.
Learn what works in your market and how that might differ from other countries.
Nielsen BookScan sales data can be analysed by various criteria, including category, publisher, and format, allowing users to see which genres are selling in which format. Users can track market trends to see which titles are driving the results, and patterns can easily be interpreted. In addition, the actual selling price is included. This inclusion makes it easier to identify trends for the level of discounting (e.g. by title, author, genre, format, region, and publisher) when analysing book sales.

# Project context
Nielsen is seeking to invest in developing a new service aimed at small to medium-sized independent publishers. This service is aimed at supporting publishers in using historical sales data to make data-driven decisions about their future investment in new publications. Their publisher customers are interested in being able to make more accurate predictions of the overall sales profile post-publication for better stock control and initial investment, but they are also interested in understanding the useful economic life span that a title may have. 

Nielsen is targeting small to medium-sized independent publishers as their research has shown that there is a strong demand for this insight, but businesses cannot invest in this infrastructure and would pay a premium to have access to quality-assured data and analysis in this area. Producing a new publication requires a significant upfront investment, and they would like to be able to more accurately identify books with strong long-term potential. More specifically, they are looking for titles with sales patterns that exhibit well-established seasonal patterns and positive trends that show potential great returns and to learn more about these types of publications. Nielsen will then apply this understanding to their commission and print volume strategy to be more successful in acquiring titles that have longevity. Additionally, this will enable them to deliver better returns by ensuring the correct stock levels in relation to demand and avoiding over- or understocking, which can be costly. 

You will notice that some titles experience fluctuations in sales due to various factors, such as increased media attention or cultural relevance (e.g. the recent resurgence of interest in George Orwell’s 1984). However, certain books endure over time and are often studied in academic settings for their deeper significance. 

For this project, Nielsen has provided you with two data sets. The objective is to identify sales patterns that demonstrate seasonal trends or any other traits, providing insights to inform reordering, restocking, and reprinting decisions for various books (by their International Standard Book Number, or ISBN).
